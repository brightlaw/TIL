# RESTful API
##### Representation State Transfer
##### based on ROA(Resource Oriented Architecture)

### What is it about?
Another way of defining HTTP URI

### Another way?
In this RESTful way, HTTP URI specifies the resource intuitively and runs CRUD operatoins only using HTTP Method
which is POST, GET, PUT, DELETE.

So, unlike the traditional way we can't see any these four methods in the URI. We call this 'statelessness'

And URI is focused on the resource transfered, which makes it easy to understand what URI we use is for.

### Characteristics
1. Stateless
###### As mentioned above it is stateless. There is no HTTP Method in URI. And also there is no data that holds information about where an user was, is and will be in the web page

2. Addressability
###### RESTful API allows users to access all objects repectively with unique & intuitive URI

3. Homogeneous Interface
###### It serves only through HTTP Method(POST, GET, PUT, DELETE).

4. Connectedness
###### A resource can be represented and expected by a relationship of other resources we can see in the URI
