# Proxy Server
##### A proxy server means a substitute server that takes requests from clients and responses on behalf of a real server which those requests originally try to get access to.

##### What is the role of this server? & How does it work?
It stores data from an original server in a form of cache. So this can boost efficiency and speed of data exchanging. And it also can make a contribution to reduction of network traffic by reducing requests heading to a real server.
